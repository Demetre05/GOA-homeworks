    <h1>Samsung</h1>

        <p>Founded in 1938 by Lee Byung-chul as a trading company, Samsung diversified into various sectors, including food<br>
        processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail, over the next three decades. In the late 1960s, Samsung entered<br>
        the electronics industry, followed by the construction and shipbuilding sectors in the mid-1970s—areas that would fuel<br>
        its future growth. After Lee died in 1987, Samsung was divided into five business groups: Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group,<br>
        CJ Group, Hansol Group, and JoongAng Group.</p>

        <p>In 1938, during the Japanese era, Lee Byung-chul (1910-1987), a member of a large landowning family in Ginei moved to<br>
        nearby Taikyu and founded Mitsuboshi Trading Company (株式会社三星商会 (Kabushiki gaisha Mitsuboshi Shōkai)), or Samsung<br>
        Sanghoe (주식회사 삼성상회). Samsung started out as a small trading company with forty employees located in Su-dong<br>
        (now Ingyo-dong).[15] It dealt in dried fish,[15] locally-grown groceries and noodles.[16] The company prospered and<br>
        Lee moved its head office to Seoul in 1947. When the Korean War broke out, he was forced to leave Seoul. He started a<br>
        sugar refinery in Pusan named Cheil Jedang. In 1954, Lee founded Cheil Mojik, a textiles company, and built the first<br>
        plant in Chimsan-dong, Taegu. It was the largest woollen mill in the country at the time of construction.[17]</p>
