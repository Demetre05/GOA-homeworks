<h1>lion</h1>
<p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, currently found only in Sub-Saharan Africa and India.
 It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears.</p>
<h1>Etimology</h1>
<p>The English word lion is derived via Anglo-Norman liun from Latin leōnem (nominative: leō), which in turn was a borrowing from
 Ancient Greek λέων léōn.</p>
<h1>Taxonomy</h1>
<p>Felis leo was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the lion in his work Systema Naturae.[3] The genus
 name Panthera was coined by Lorenz Oken in 1816.[8]</p>
<h2>subspecies</h2>
<p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, several lion type specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, with about a dozen recognised
 as valid taxa until 2017.[11]</p>
<h3>Evolution</h3>
<p>The Panthera lineage is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the Felidae around 10.8 million years ago.
[29] Hybridisation between lion and snow leopard ancestors possibly continued until about 2.1 million years ago.</p>
 <h1>Description</h1>
 <p>The lion is a muscular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck, and round ears; males have broader heads.
 The fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red, and dark brown.[44]</p>
